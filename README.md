Hello Guys.
From my experience i can say that installation of DevOps Tools is not a easy task for everyone. I think you all have already realised that how much time we are wasted in installing the tools by deviating from our main goal that is to Learn Thoes Tools. So I decided to write down all the shellscripts and instllation procedure that really helpfull to you and can save a lot of precious time of yours.

For ALl the Shellscript related Installations Follow These Steps Bellow :-
1. To run this shellscript first create a shellscript file using vi editor:: vi file_name.sh  and paste the shellscript codes
2. Now run this command to give execute permission to the shellscript file::  sudo chmod +x file_name.sh
3. Now run the shellscript with command::    sh file_name.sh
